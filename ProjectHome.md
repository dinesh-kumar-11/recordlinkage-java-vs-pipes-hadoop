The project performs Record Linkage (RL) using an open sourced package (fuzzyJoin-UCI) over java based Hadoop. Our goal is to write the same implementation in C++ and materialize the work. Then, we plan to write our own java based RL algorithm along with our own filtering and compare performance with the java based package performance. We are using the sampled data provided by the package and synthetically increase as needed.
